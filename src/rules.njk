        <h3>Roster Settings</h3>
        <p>Standard roster that replaces TE with a WR/TE flex. This makes teams less reliant on TE roulette since the TE position drops off so hard, and brings more value to mid-tier WRs. </p><br>

        <h3>Defensive Scoring</h3>
            <p>We use use modified defensive scoring to try and better represent the in-game impact of a defense. The main goal is to reduce the chance that a defense can score big in fantasy while getting destroyed in real life. <br/><br/>
            The first few scores against a defense have a smaller penalty, later scores have a greater penalty, and the overall max penalty for points allowed is increased. There is also an added penalty for 400 and 500 yards allowed.

    <h3>Keeper Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Up to 2 keepers per team</li>
            <li>Keeping players is optional</li>
            <li>Players drafted in Round 1 cannot be selected as keepers. This keeps a healthy pool of elite players in the draft mix each year.</li>
            <li>The same player can only be selected as a keeper for two consecutive seasons, at which point they return to the draft pool.</li>
        </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Keeper Costs</h3>
    <p>The cost to keep a player depends on if and where they were last drafted.</p>
        <h4>Cost to Keep Drafted Players </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeper cost is equal to the player‚Äôs most recent draft position</b>, e.g. a player selected in round 4 in 2021 costs a 4th round pick to keep in 2022.</li>
            <li><b>Keeping players for a second consecutive season increases the cost by one round</b>, so a 4th round selection costs a 3rd round pick to keep a second time.</li>   
        </ul>
        <div class="blockquote-container">
            <h5 class="blockquote-header"><em>Example</em></h5>
            <blockquote class="styled-blockquote">
                Season 1: Mark Andrews was drafted 6th round 2020</br> 
                Season 2: Andrews cost a 6th rd pick to keep in 2021</br>
                Season 3: Andrews cost a 5th rd pick to keep in 2022 </br>
                In 2023, Andrews is returned to the draft pool
            </blockquote>
        </div>
    <hr> 
    <h4>Cost to Keep Undrafted Free Agents</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Any player in the most recent draft is a UDFA</li> 
            <li>Keeping a UDFA costs an <b>8th round pick</b> for the first year</li>
            <li>Keeping a UDFA costs a <b>7th round pick</b> for the second year</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="blockquote-container">
            <h5 class="blockquote-header"><em>Example</em></h5>
            <blockquote class="styled-blockquote">
                Season 1: Justin Jefferson was acquired as a UDFA in 2020</br> 
                Season 2: Jefferson cost a 8th rd pick to keep in 2021</br>
                Season 3: Jefferson cost a 7th rd pick to keep in 2022</br>
                In 2023, Jefferson is returned to the draft pool
            </blockquote>

    <h3>Keeper FAQs</h3>

    <h5>What if I want to keep two UDFAs, or two players drafted in the same round?</h5>

    <p>In this situation, the cost for the second keeper increases by one round. So keeping 2 UDFAs costs an 8th and 7th round pick. Keeping two players drafted in the 10th round costs a 10th and a 9th round pick.</p></br>

    <h5>If I only keep a player for one season, can I pick him again in the draft?</h5>

    <p>Yes, if you return a player to the draft pool and have the opportunity to draft them back onto your roster, you can do this and the keeper costs will reset.</p></br>
