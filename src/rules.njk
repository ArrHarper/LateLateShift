        <h3>Roster Settings</h3>
        <p>Since the TE position drops off hard after the top 1-2, we've replaced it with a WR/TE flex. This makes teams less reliant on TE roulette and brings more value to mid-tier WRs. </p><br>

        <h3>Defensive Scoring</h3>
            <p>We use modified scoring for defense, designed to properly reward or penalize based on in-game impact, and limit the chance for a defense to score big in fantasy while getting blown out in real life. <br/><br/>
            This system penalizes less for the first few scores, to reflect that NFL defenses give up an average of ~22 points per game (as of '22), and then penalties get steeper with more points and yards allowed.<br/><br/>

    <h3>Keeper Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Up to <b>2 keepers per team</b>. Keeping players is <b>optional</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Players can be kept for 2 consecutive seasons</b> after their draft year, then returned to the draft pool.</li>
            <li><b>Players drafted in the 1st round are are ineligible and cannot be kept</b>. This keeps a healthy pool of elite players in the draft mix each year.</li>
        </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Keeping Drafted Players</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Keeper cost is equal to the player‚Äôs most recent draft position</b>, e.g. a player selected in round 4 in 2021 costs a 4th round pick to keep in 2022.</li>
            <li><b>Keeping players for a second consecutive season increases the cost by one round</b>, so a 4th round selection costs a 3rd round pick to keep a second time.</li>   
        </ul>
        <div class="blockquote-container">
            <h4 class="blockquote-header"><em>Example</em></h4>
            <blockquote class="styled-blockquote">
                Mark Andrews was drafted 6th round 2020.</br> 
                Andrews costs a 6th rd pick to keep in 2021,</br>
                Andrews costs a 5th rd pick to keep in 2022. </br>
                In 2023, Andrews is ineligible and returns to the draft pool.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
    <hr> 
    <h3>Keeping Undrafted Free Agents (UDFAs)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Undrafted Free Agents (UDFA) are players <i>not drafted by any team</i> in the most recent draft.</li> 
            <li>Keeping a UDFA costs an <b>8th round pick</b> for the first year. </li>
            <li>Keeping a UDFA costs a <b>7th round pick</b> for the second year. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="blockquote-container">
            <h4 class="blockquote-header"><em>Example</em></h4>
            <blockquote class="styled-blockquote">
                Justin Jefferson was signed as an UDFA in 2020.</br> 
                Jefferson costs a 8th rd pick to keep in 2021,</br>
                Jefferson costs a 7th rd pick to keep in 2022.</br>
                In 2023, Jefferson is ineligible and returns to the draft pool.

    <h3>Keeper FAQs</h3>

    <h5>What if I want to keep two UDFAs, or two players drafted in the same round?</h5>

    <p>In this situation, the cost for the second keeper increases by one round. So keeping 2 UDFAs costs an 8th and 7th round pick. Keeping two players drafted in the 10th round costs a 10th and a 9th round pick.</p></br>

    <h5>If I only keep a player for one season, can I pick him again in the draft?</h5>

    <p>Yes, if you return a player to the draft pool and have the opportunity to draft them back onto your roster, you can do this and the keeper costs will reset.</p></br>
