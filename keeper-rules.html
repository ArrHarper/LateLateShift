                <h3>General</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Up to <b>2 keepers per team</b>. Keeping players is <b>optional</b>.</li>
                        <li> Keeper selection deadline is 24 hours prior to Draft Time.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Keeper Eligibility</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Players can be kept for 2 consecutive seasons</b> after their draft year, then returned to the draft pool.</li>
                        <li><b>Players drafted in the 1st round are are ineligible and cannot be kept</b>. This keeps a healthy pool of elite players in the draft mix each year.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>Cost to Keep Drafted Players</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Keeper cost is equal to the playerâ€™s most recent draft position</b>, e.g. a player selected in round 4 in 2021 costs a 4th round pick to keep in 2022.</li>
                        <li><b>Keeping players for a second consecutive season increases the cost by one round</b>, so a 4th round selection costs a 3rd round pick to keep a second time.</li>   
                    </ul>

                            Andrews costs a 5th rd pick to keep in 2022. </br>
                            In 2023, Andrews is ineligible and returns to the draft pool.

                <h3>Cost to Keep Undrafted Free Agents (UDFAs)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Undrafted Free Agents (UDFA) are players <i>not drafted by any team</i> in the most recent draft.</li> 
                        <li>Keeping a UDFA costs an <b>8th round pick</b> for the first year. </li>
                        <li>Keeping a UDFA costs a <b>7th round pick</b> for the second year. </li>

                            Jefferson costs a 8th rd pick to keep in 2021,</br>
                            Jefferson costs a 7th rd pick to keep in 2022.</br>

                <h3>FAQ</h3>

                <h5>What if I want to keep two UDFAs, or two players drafted in the same round?</h5>

                <p>In this situation, the cost for the second keeper increases by one round. So keeping 2 UDFAs costs an 8th and 7th round pick. Keeping two players drafted in the 10th round costs a 10th and a 9th round pick.</p></br>

                <h5>If I only keep a player for one season, can I pick him again in the draft?</h5>

                <p>Yes, if you return a player to the draft pool and have the opportunity to draft them back onto your roster, you can do this and the keeper costs will reset.</p></br>
